		 <blockquote>"Just as the actor tells a story, the wardrobe helps to tell the clothed characters story as well. The costume speaks before the actor ever does. To see the finished costume on an actor or model and know that I had a part in helping them immerse themselves into their new character is pure joy."</blockquote>
